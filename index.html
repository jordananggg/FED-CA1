        <p>My Values: <br> I greatly value living an environmentally friendly lifestyle in order to leave a positive impact on Earth's environment. I also strongly believe in raising awareness on the problems our environment faces, such as deforestation.  
            Also, I believe that the younger generation should lobby for change of old practices which cause great harm to the environment, such as the burning of fossil fuels. 
        </p>
