    <header>1. Having Many Water Dispensers</header>
    
    <p>Did you know that there are over 110 water dispensers located across SP? Having these water dispensers help cultivate eco-conscious habits by encouraging students and staff to use water dispensers around campus. This also allows SP to stop providing bottled water at events, greatly decreasing waste produced!</p>

    <header>2. Diversity of Flora</header>

    <p>There are currently 230 of flora which are thriving in SP, including Brown Woolly Fig Heritage Trees found near Food Court 1! This diversity in plants not only allows for the preservation of these species, carbon dioxide levels in the area could decrease due to the sheer abundance of plants!</p>
