    <p>Firstly, one thing we can do to save the earth is to conserve energy at home. By conserving energy, we can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the burning of fossil fuels which generates power for our homes. For instance, we can used LED lightbulbs which are more energy efficient, helping us to save energy. </p>
    
    <p>Another way we can help to save the earth is to take public transport instead of driving cars. By taking public transport, there will be less vehicles on the road, greatly reducing GHG emissions. </p>

    <p>In addition, we can also regularly practice the 3Rs, reduce, reuse & recycle! Through reducing, reusing and recycling, we will be able to greatly decrease the amount of waste generated by people. This also decreases the need for us to produce new products, which will help in decreasing GHG emissions. Furthermore, we will also be able to save on important resources such as water by practicing the 3Rs! For example, 2700 litres of water is used in making a cotton shirt. Instead of buying a new shirt, we can buy thrifted clothes in good condition, greatly reducing water wastage. Actions such as these can help in saving the earth! </p>
